1. News Management:
There's currently no implementation for news management. You'll need to create a News model, repository, service, and controller to handle this functionality.
Admin-specific Member Management:
While members can manage their own profiles, there's no specific implementation for admins to manage other members. You'll need to add this functionality to the MemberService and MemberController, with appropriate authorization checks.
Authorization:
The current implementation doesn't show how admin-only routes are protected. You'll need to implement role-based access control to ensure that only admins can access certain endpoints.
To fully implement these features, you'll need to:
Create a News system (model, repository, service, controller).
2. Implement admin-specific member management methods in MemberService and MemberController.
Add role-based access control to protect admin-only routes.
Update the FacilityService to allow admins to manage facilities.
These additions will complete the functionality you've described, allowing members to book facilities and manage their memberships, while admins can post news and manage members and facilities.
